## Vector Classes

Conformance vectors fall into **two distinct classes**, and the summary counts
above must not conflate them:

- **Crypto re-derivation class** (`handshake`, `delegation`, `delegation_chain`,
  `enrollment`, `merkle_inclusion`, `signature_verification`, `sd_jwt`,
  `proof_envelope`, `session_token`). The runner re-derives the crypto in-process
  (Poseidon / EdDSA / Merkle) and checks the expected PASS/FAIL result. It never
  spawns a subprocess.

- **IO-contract class** (`external_verifier`). These vectors exercise the
  host↔verifier *wire contract* defined in
  [External Verifier Contract v1](external-verifier-contract-v1.md): the runner
  **spawns the built `bolyra verify` command**, pipes the vector's §2.1 request to
  the child's stdin, reads exactly one stdout verdict, and diffs it against
  `expected.verdict` (and `expected.code` for denies). `expected.result`
  (PASS/FAIL, required by the schema) means "did the verifier behave as
  specified"; the *semantic* outcome lives in `expected.verdict` / `expected.code`.
  Each spawn runs with a fresh temporary `$HOME` so the verifier's local nonce
  store is isolated, and points `--circuits-dir` at committed Groth16 verifying
  keys (verify-only; no proving). This class tests the transport and verdict
  envelope, not the internal crypto — do not fold verdict logic into the
  re-derivation harness.

## Normative Requirements

The following requirements are semantic constraints that the JSON Schema cannot
express. A conformant implementation MUST satisfy all of them.

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "SHOULD", and "MAY" in this section are to be
interpreted as described in [RFC 2119](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc2119).

### Nonce Replay

A conformant implementation MUST reject a handshake proof that reuses a
`sessionNonce` seen in any prior verified handshake within the same scope.
Implementations SHOULD maintain a nonce registry scoped to the verifier's
operational lifetime.

### Token Replay

A session token MUST be rejected if its nonce has been consumed by a prior
verification within the token's audience scope. Stateless verifiers MAY use
short-lived nonce windows instead of persistent registries.

### Vault JTI Uniqueness

SD-JWT issuers MUST generate globally unique JTI values. Collision across any
two receipts issued by the same issuer constitutes a conformance failure.
Implementations SHOULD use UUID v4 or equivalent entropy source.

### Audience Binding

An SD-JWT receipt presented to an audience not matching the `aud` claim MUST be
rejected, even if the cryptographic signature is valid. The audience comparison
MUST be case-sensitive and exact-match.

### Nullifier Binding

Session tokens MUST include the `humanNullifierHash` from the originating
handshake as a claim. Tokens without this binding are non-conformant. Verifiers
MUST check that the nullifier claim matches the handshake that produced the
session.

### Forward Compatibility

Implementations MUST preserve unknown fields in proof envelopes without error.
Rejecting unknown fields is a conformance failure. This enables protocol
evolution without breaking existing implementations.
